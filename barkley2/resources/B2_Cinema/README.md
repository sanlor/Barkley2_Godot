This tries to replicate the original cinema system. No Idea how, to be honest.
24-02-25 - I have some idea how, now.

## B2_Script_Legacy
Simulates the old Cinema system.
Its a huge text file, parsed line by line, with commands and parameters separated by "|".
Ex.: DIALOG | Christina | `w2`What am I gonna do?`w0`

## B2_ScriptActions
Parent class of the new system, mostly used by the combat system right now.

DIALOG | Kalevi | Ah, a new arrival, eh? Here's a little tip from your friendly neighbourhood blacksmith: Don't let the duergar beatings get to you, youngster. You will get used to them eventually.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, you're Kalevi, right? From Tir na nog?
DIALOG | Kalevi | Aye, that's me. You look a bit familiar yourself, youngster. I take it that we've met before?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, that's right. How come you're here in the mines, mister Kalevi?
DIALOG | Kalevi | Heh, believe it or not but the governor himself assigned me here not too long ago.
DIALOG | P_NAME | (Oh, that's right...)
DIALOG | Kalevi | I take it that you were assigned here as well? Those blue brutes must have maimed one slave too many if they are shipping new recruits all the way from tir na nog.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Actually, I'm... Uh, nary ye mind.
DIALOG | Kalevi | Oh? Suit yourself, youngster. I don't really care either way. All I care about is swinging this hammer.

KALEVI_QUESTIONS
CHOICE | Ask Kalevi something?
REPLY  | KALE_MAKE  | What are you working on?
REPLY  | KALE_MINES | What do you know about the mines?
REPLY  | KALE_GUNS  | Can you make a gun for me?
REPLY  | KALE_LEAVE | I'd better keep going.

KALE_MAKE
DIALOG | P_NAME | What are you working on?
DIALOG | Kalevi | Oh, I'm just making some repairs for the mining equipment. It's surprising how fast pickaxes can break down.
DIALOG | Kalevi | Is there something else you wanted?
GOTO   | KALEVI_QUESTIONS

KALE_MINES
DIALOG | P_NAME | What do you know about the mines?
DIALOG | Kalevi | What's there to know? Cuchulainn had this place dug open ages ago in hopes of finding some relic, or whatever he was after. 
DIALOG | Kalevi | Couple of days ago they brought in a lot more duergars down here to crack the whip on those big nosed guys. Most of the operations were moved out of the `kw`Beta Camp,`rt` and into other parts of the mines. Beta Camp is where we are right now, the big open area just outside my quarters.
DIALOG | P_NAME | So what does it mean that they did all that?
DIALOG | Kalevi | Beats me. I guess they found what they were looking for and moved on to something else.
DIALOG | Kalevi | Is there something else you wanted?
GOTO   | KALEVI_QUESTIONS

KALE_GUNS
DIALOG | P_NAME | Can you make a gun for me?
DIALOG | Kalevi | Hah! You want me to work on some brastware?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah. I bet a skilled craftsman like you could make some truly epic gun's.
DIALOG | Kalevi | Oh, I know how to make some proper gun's alright, but with all these duergars down here my chances of not getting caught are close to nil. No dice, buddy.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Aw, shucks...
DIALOG | Kalevi | Is there something else you wanted?
GOTO   | KALEVI_QUESTIONS

KALE_LEAVE
DIALOG | P_NAME | It was nice chatting with you but I'd better keep moving.
DIALOG | Kalevi | Alright, if you say so."

/*
This is the Global Greeting for all who start Barkley 2.  This is starting in the debug mode as a way to
remind everyone to keep out of Wilmer's house when testing (unless you are testing Wilmer directly.)

Eventually this can be moved over to the Normal Mode and will be used to leave notes to players, specifically
external testers, who might want some notes before starting the game.

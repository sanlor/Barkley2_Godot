DIALOG | Absalom | Correct! This is the `mq`Tir na Nog branch of L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S..`rt` It's quite amazing to me that you managed to find us! I'm a little concerned you'll compromise our safety! 
DIALOG | Absalom | I'm Absalom, the group technician. I assist `kw`Dr. Liu,`rt` our leader, with... secret weapons. Private Madison handles weapon supplies and our poker players over there handle the poker games.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | You're supposed to be fighting the Duergars, right? That's all of you?
DIALOG | Absalom | Correct again! L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. is the dwarf resistance force. We try to stymie the Duergars as much as we can, and improve living conditions for the dwarfs of Necron 7. We may be small group, but we're dedicated to the cause of dwarf liberation.

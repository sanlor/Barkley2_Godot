IF longinusGov == 0 | DIALOG | Pvt. Madison | Pretty funny that it went exactly as I thought it would.

I've been sitting on some explosives for a while now - the good stuff, not that firecracker black powder crap - and I think the Governor's speech is the right time to use it. Think about it - if it goes off during the speech, the Governor and half the Duergars in Tir na Nog are history. There'll be riots in the streets, dwarfs fighting against Duergars, the oppressed killing the oppressor. This is the opportunity we've been waiting for and I don't want to let it slip.

There's a brass plaque on the front, and for weeks now, every night at midnight I've given each screw a quarter turn, under the cover of darkness. I finally got it loose, and nobody's the wiser. What you need to do is enter the square, place the bomb behind the plaque, and set it to explode during the new Governor's speech. I can see it already... Cuchulainn's statue rupturing in fire, shrapnel and dead Duergars everywhere! Don't worry about the crowd. There'll be collateral damage, but the important thing is that we wipe out the Governor and his lackeys. When the people see their opportunity, they'll take it. I can take over from there and you can slip out. We all win.

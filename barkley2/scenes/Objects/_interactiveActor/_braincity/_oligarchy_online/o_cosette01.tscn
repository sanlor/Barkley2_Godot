PAY_OPTION_1
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Tell me about the Unlimited Plan, please.
DIALOG | Cosette | The Unlimited Plan covers all connectivity fees and in-realm purchases using digi-ducats spending. 
DIALOG | Cosette | That costs a flat, discounted, fee of `sq`@money_ooUnlimited@ neuro-shekels,`rt` and you'll be automatically renewed each month. Fees are paid at the incept of your billing cycle, which coincidentally is_ `kw`NOW.`rt`

PAY_OPTION_2
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Tell me about the Hourly Plan, please.
DIALOG | Cosette | The Hourly Plan is the most versatile, allowing you connections for one hour of Oligarchy activity at a time. Much like the Unlimited Plan, it gives you unlimited access to the system, but you'll only get 120 digi-ducats to spend. 
DIALOG | Cosette | Hourly fees are assessed at the incept of your billing cycle, which is NOW, and you'll need to authorize your neuro-shekel bank to automatically debit for each hour spent in Oligarchy Online. That's `sq`@money_ooHourly@ neuro-shekels.`rt`

DIALOG | P_NAME  | Tell me about the Pay-As-You-Pwn Plan, please.
DIALOG | Cosette | For a premium rate, you can forgo a payment plan and connect your neural currency bank directly to our digi-ducats servers and navigate through Oligarchy Online through the power of microtransactions. 
DIALOG | Cosette | You'll need to authorize just like in the other plans, but you'll only be charged a starting fee of `sq`@money_ooPayp_Reup@ neuro-shekels`rt` to begin, and then charged the same `kw`re-up`rt` fee each time you need ducats.

PLANTATION_AFTERMATH
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, guess what I just did!
DIALOG | Putty  | ...I don't know.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I just gave that fat guy a lesson he will not soon forget!
DIALOG | Putty  | What fat guy?
DIALOG | P_NAME | The....the fat guy! The one who runs the plantation! You're free! You can leave!!!
DIALOG | Putty  | Why bother. I've been here my whole life, just like a couple others here. I tried escaping a couple times, and BABBY always just finds me and brings me back.
DIALOG | P_NAME | But there's nobody to take you back anymore! Everything is fixed!
DIALOG | Putty  | There's nothing out there for me. I escaped for a couple months one time. I didn't know what to do. Farming is all I know. I'm better off just staying here, sticking to what I know.
DIALOG | P_NAME | But-
DIALOG | Putty  | Thanks for going through all the trouble to save us. I wish I had something to give you, but I don't have anything. You're a nice person, I hope being told that is its own reward.
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...
QUEST  | puttyState = 2

PUTTY_0
DIALOG | Putty  | Did you see Grigory on the way here?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know. Who is Grigory?
DIALOG | Putty  | Grigory is my best friend. He tried to escape but Rubby went after him. I heard some laser fire, but Rubby came back alone. I was hoping Grigory managed to escape...
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't think I saw your friend. Maybe he got away?
DIALOG | Putty  | You would have seen him running. Grigory is big and slow. He cannot hide so well.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm sure he got away. He probably just went a different way.
DIALOG | Putty  | I doubt it. BABBY vaporizes anybody who escapes now. That's probably why you didn't see him. Well, thanks for talking to me. I better get back to work before BABBY cuts another one of my toes off. I don't have many left.

PUTTY_2
DIALOG | Putty  | You better get going. Eventually someone else will show up and claim the plantation. The cycle always repeats."

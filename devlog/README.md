Project start. 
Today I started by creating a Win 7 VM, downloading lots of sketchy versions of Gamemaker Studio 1.4 (I actually have a valid license, but the support from
GMS told me that they cant provide a downoad link anymore).
I can open and run the game from the editor, so now I can start my work. Instead of jumping in without a plan, I decided to plan and define an initial scope.
good work for today.

reading and understanding scripts. some people poured a lot of love and effort on this game. the Cinema script is very impressive.
Really hope I can make this work on Godot.

They are wild and primitive, bellicose and deceitful... but I believe we can civilize them through Clispaeth. More importantly, I believe it's our responsibility as Klispins to save their souls.

WHOISCLISP
DIALOG | P_NAME           | Who's this Clispaeth character I keep hearing about?
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | Historically, `kw`Clispaeth Ryuji Atuck`rt` was a freedom fighter in the Holy Land who fought against the Roman Empire. He was killed in the `kw`Boston Massacre`rt` when his apostle `kw`Judas`rt` betrayed him to Emperor Constantine. But more importantly, he was a prophet, the person who brought the holy word to the people. His death heralded the `mq`Cyberpocalypse...`rt` but also salvation for all people and his message of Klispianity has since spread across the galaxy.

GOTO   | QUESTIONSCLISP

WHATBELIEFS
DIALOG | P_NAME           | So what exactly do Klispins believe?
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | Clispaeth's message was twofold. First, it was a lifestyle, a way to treat other people. It's complex but can ultimately be boiled down to treating others with kindness and compassion. His other message was that he would one day return and bring his followers salvation. By following his lifestyle of compassion, you can be saved when Clispaeth returns.

GOTO   | QUESTIONSCLISP

HOWTOBEGOOD
DIALOG | P_NAME           | So how am I supposed to be a good Klispin?
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | Well, the most important way is by treating people with compassion and kindness. Help people in need, be honest with them and always do what you promise to do. That's the Klispin way. You can also spread the good news of Clispaeth to people who haven't heard it. That is my life's work and I am wholly dedicated to it. Is there anything else?
GOTO   | QUESTIONSCLISP

CLISPMESSAGE
DIALOG | P_NAME           | What was Clispaeth's message?
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | Clispaeth's message was complex and multi-faceted, but it was ultimately a message of peace, compassion and empathy. It was a message of kindness, that we should respect and help our fellow man and dwarf and by doing so, we will be rewarded in the next life.
GOTO   | QUESTIONSCLISP

WHOWASJUDAS
DIALOG | P_NAME           | Who was this Judas guy?
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | Judas was Clispaeth's chief disciple and best friend. And sadly, also his betrayer. Judas tried to usurp Clispaeth's position as the head of the Klispin movement and when he failed, sold Clispaeth to the Romans, who killed him in an event known as the Boston Massacre. 
DIALOG | P_NAME           | He sounds like a real rat.
KNOW   | knowJudas | 2
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | It's likely that he was a Roman spy all along, planted to weaken and sow dissension within the burgeoning Klispin movement. Clispaeth's death was bittersweet; it brought hardship to all Klispins and heralded the Cyberpocalypse, but it also brought redemption to all of his followers. Someday soon, Clispaeth will return and deliver all of his followers unto salvation.

GOTO   | QUESTIONSCLISP

CYBERPOCALYPSE
DIALOG | P_NAME           | Hey, that `mq`Cyberpocalypse`rt` thing sounds familiar. What is that?
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | When Clispaeth died, the Klispins and Romans fought for 666 years in a battle that devastated all that it touched. It ended when the Romans, under Emperor Constantine, finally adopted Klispianity, but by then it was too late. The galaxy was destroyed and we are living in the consequences of that war: the Post-Cyberpocalypse.
DIALOG | P_NAME           | But what about b-ball?

DIALOG | P_NAME           | Wow. This sounds like a bunch of baloney. I can't believe you buy this bunk.
DIALOG | Sister Irmingard | A lot of people have doubts about their faith and it's perfectly normal. Even if you don't believe that Clispaeth will return and bring his followers salvation, I believe his message of compassion and empathy is universal, not exclusive to Klispins. There is room for improvement in all of us; if we can accomplish it through Clispaeth, whether or not we believe in the theological component of his teachings, I believe we can become better people.

They were part of a tontine together and were its last remaining members; the death of one would directly profit the other. When Figbottom died, Kunigunde inherited the money from the tontine.

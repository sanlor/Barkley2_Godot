DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | What in the zooks do you mean?!
DIALOG | Benedict | SGICSO... The Sombrero Galaxy Introductory Charter School for Orphans... Thirty short years ago... I walk to my seat in the cafeteria, where I always sit, where I always minded my own business. I look down... a Choco-mallow on the ground, perfect in everyway. /'How lucky could one orphan be?/' I thought to myself. I reach down to pick up my new prize and... the mallow MOVES ON IT'S OWN. I drop my tray of /'Grapes Melange/' and dive for the mallow, it bounces away from my grasp._ I fall to the dirty floor of the orphanage as the other orphans erupt in laughter! Their cruel chuckles stin' and cut like pirahna bites. A third time I reach for the mallow, it just beyond my chubby orphan fin'ers. But this time I see somethin', a hook... a hook protrudin' from the confection, a ubiquitous monofilament line is fastened securely to it. I follow the clear line with my eyes, for even in my orphan days I am a skilled angler, and can make out the barely visible signature of 10-stone test line from even the free throw line. The cord stretches from the mallow down and alongside the crowded cafeteria benches. The benches brim and roil with riant orphan hecklers, churnin' in the merriment of schadenfreude. I am a laughin'stock. And that is when I see him... at the opposite end of the line from my would-be prize. Turald, that rat-bastard, he wears a grin as wide as his bullshit face would allow. He always was the alpha orphan... and he is makin' painfully clear with this sadistic prank. Through the tears wellin' up and overflowin' onto my rosy orphan cheeks I see Turald saunter over to me, standin' on the same dirty floor that I could not sink low enough into... he leans down to me, the smirk I so desperately loathe mere inches from my ear... he says...

DIALOG | Benedict | Well, I don't think I'll be needin' this fishin' pole anymore... I've been sittin' around waitin' for this moment for so long, walkin' down to this spot everyday just to listen for that big splash of Turald hittin' the water. You take it.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Take your fishing pole?
DIALOG | Benedict | Yeah go for it, take it. My gift, I won't need it. I won't need this lure either so you can have that as well. I'm just goin' to sit here for a while longer just wrap my head around everythin'..._ stay strong, P_NAME_S.

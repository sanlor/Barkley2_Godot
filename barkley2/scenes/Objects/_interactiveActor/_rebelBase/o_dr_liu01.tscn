You'll then `sq`use the body to infiltrate the Governor's Mansion and steal back a Top Secret Dossier.`rt` With that dossier in hand, we'll be able to start `kw`PHASE TWO`rt` of the mission!
DIALOG | P_NAME  | What if the Duergars ask me to do something as governor?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | To be a convincing governor, you'll have to act like one. `kw`Elagabalus`rt` is known for his ruthless and wanton persecution in the Hoosegow... I imagine the Duergars will be expecting a lot of that from him once he arrives.
GOTO   | SNIP_QUESTION

REPLY_WHAT_LONGINUS
DIALOG | P_NAME  | So what's L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. all about?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well, L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. is about a lot of things. For some dwarfs, it's about fighting Cuchulainn. For others, it's about escaping from the Necron 7. For even more, it's about `kw`Pan-Dwarfism.`rt` But for all of us, it's about autonomy; Cuchulainn doesn't have the right to corral up all the dwarfs in the galaxy into this spaceship, whether or not he's going to give us all a fabulous prize.

We're a small branch of L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. and we're cut off from the main group, I don't really know much more and I couldn't tell you where he is.

DIALOG | P_NAME  | Yeah, but_ why?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | So we're a fledgling branch of L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. here in Tir na nog. I just recently started to get our `kw`carrier rats`rt` trained enough to carry on proper comms with Headquarters.

DIALOG | P_NAME  | Dunkirk?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | All I know is the codename. The rest of the mission briefing was `sq`contained in a sealed, Top Secret Document sent directly from LONGINUS Headquarters.`rt` Unfortunately and need I say, `w1`depressingly,`w0` the dosser was confiscated by Duergar Censors on it's way into Tir na Nog circulation.
DIALOG |  P_NAME | Maybe you shouldn't have mailed it?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well you see, just recently, a golden opportunity came up: the last governor got transferred. There were `kw`explicit reasons why,`rt` but we don't have to get into them.

DIALOG | Dr. Liu | We're getting a new governor right now so things are all up in the air. That's why we need to strike. If we wait for the traditional Inaugural Address it could be too late. At every inaugural address, the governor lays out their plans for the future of Tir na nOg. Usually they're about indiscriminate torture roundups or food rationing. But before the Governor gives the address, they normally have free reign of the mansion, and that's exactly where my `kw`Top Secret Dossier`kw` is!

REPLY_IMIN
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Okay, I'm in. What do I need to do?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | `w1`Fantastic!`w0` I knew I could count on you! So here's how it goes down: we somehow kidnap the governor, you switch bodies with him using the body transference device and `sq`sneak into the mansion and get the Dossier.`rt` After that, get back, switch back to your old body and `kw`Operation: Reverse Dunkirk`rt` will have entered `kw`PHASE TWO.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | This sounds unbelievably complicated. How are we supposed to kidnap the incoming governor?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well, that's the tricky part. But I have an idea... see, Duergars are instinctively territorial creatures. They mark their turf with... ahh... well,_ their `kw`urine.`rt` _ When a Duergar urinates on something, it indicates that he owns it. But Duergars are also competitive and domineering creatures as well. A Duergar, attracted by the `kw`pheromones`rt` of another Duergar's urine, will urinate over it in order to prove their dominance.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | So what are you saying?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well, I think we could attract the Governor using either Duergar urine or the pheromones extracted from it. The Governor is the highest ranking Duergar in Tir na nOg and he'll want to prove it by stamping out any rivals.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | So you're saying I need to get some `kw`Duergar urine?`rt` That's pretty disgusting. Where am I even supposed to get it?

DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Excellent. I'm not even going to ask how you got it. Duergars are territorial animals and urinate to mark their turf. The pheromones in Duergar urine convey power and authority; Duergars will often urinate over another Duergar's urine in order to assert their dominance. It's my hope that we can attract the incoming governor and capture him. Go place it on the left-most chair of the body transference device.

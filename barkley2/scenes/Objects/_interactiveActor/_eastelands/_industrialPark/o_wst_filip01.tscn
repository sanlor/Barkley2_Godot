DIALOG | P_NAME | So where does the train go?
DIALOG | Filip  | Anywhere you'd want it to go. It's that kind of train, the best there is. I myself like to rest somewhere in the shade and have a little daydream about the places I want to go. Then I go there. It's like I'm following my own dreams, they do all the talking for me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Uh, ok. I just want to get as far away from here as I can.
DIALOG | Filip  | Well, it's a good thing you found me, then. Better run along now, don't want to miss that train.

POSTPURCHASE_1
DIALOG | P_NAME | So, where is the train station?
DIALOG | Filip  | It's where I get all my tickets from. You'll find it, it's right over there.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Ok, thanks.
QUEST  | wstFilip = 2
         
POSTPURCHASE_2
DIALOG | P_NAME | Are there any of those duergar guys on the train? I don't like them very much.
DIALOG | Filip  | No. Trains are a no-duergar zone. This is me fighting back against the duergar system. Imagine a poor mother, not unlike yourself, running from land mines holding her baby crying in a dark alley. This is the image that inspires me to sell train tickets. I will sell train tickets until I die.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Ok, thanks, that's all I wanted to know.
DIALOG | Filip  | Just remember to hurry and find the train station or the train will leave without you! That ticket is only good for this train. You miss it and you'll have to buy another from me.
QUEST  | wstFilip = 3

POSTPURCHASE_3
DIALOG | P_NAME | These prices are kinda high for a train ticket. Why is it so expensive?
DIALOG | Filip  | Oh? I suppose you know of a cheaper train in town, then? Come, show me this cheaper train ticket. I'll sell them instead.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know of a cheaper train. It's just expensive, that's all.
DIALOG | Filip  | That's why it's expensive, there's no other trains. You're lucky they're this cheap. Now, hurry on. You don't want to miss the train.
QUEST  | wstFilip = 4

POSTPURCHASE_4
DIALOG | P_NAME | Why aren't more people taking the train out of town? I don't think many people really like it here.
DIALOG | Filip  | I don't know. Maybe they can't afford it. Tickets aren't cheap. Maybe they're afraid to leave, afraid it's no better anywhere else. Maybe some people just love their land, no matter how polluted it gets. They're like a train, can't go anywhere but where their rails take it.......
DIALOG | P_NAME | You'd think if their life was really like a train it would take them to the train station.
DIALOG | Filip  | Fruck you, what the fruck do you know about trains? 70% of my body is made of trains. You're just a train amateur. Now scram, I don't need your stupid amateur train commentary.

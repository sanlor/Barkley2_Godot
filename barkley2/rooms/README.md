# About maps


Original maps were made in OGMO (https://ogmoeditor.itch.io/editor).
look for "oep" files and open them using an old OGMO version: https://github.com/TheSpydog/Ogmo-Editor/releases
Some old maps are still hidden in the old game files, I can convert some of them to Godot, with some luck.

File structure tries to follow GMS structure, not Godot's.

Found some old al-akihabara map files.

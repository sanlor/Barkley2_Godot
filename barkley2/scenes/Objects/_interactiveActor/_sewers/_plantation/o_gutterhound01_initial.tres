Those mother hubbards would slit your throat in an instant if they could make a dime off it. They take from the dwarfs every day. Look at this place. Look at Tir na Nog. I'm glad as hell I got out of here when I could 'cuz this is a pig sty and who do we have to thank for that? Cuchulainn and the Duergars.

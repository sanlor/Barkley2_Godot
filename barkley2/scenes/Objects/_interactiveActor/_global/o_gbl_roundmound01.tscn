REASON_SUMMON
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | I know you have been calling out, searching for something. The path of the seeker is not a route to a destination, but a lifelong duty. You know your destiny, as do I. But what you are looking for, I cannot say. You will, soon.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Y-... you heard me?
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | My compassion for you is boundless, and I can do nothing but listen. And yet here I cannot help you, only encourage you to take the first faithful step off the precipice. The future will come to pass... it has been written for eons. The future, however, does not hold insight. It does not coalesce through contemplation alone. Rather, it accretes through active existence, and accumulates not with the progression of time, but spatially, as your mindful self recollects increasingly larger segments of its eternal whole.

REASON_POWER
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | You have grown very strong in the course of your journey. What you have overcome, and how fast you have grown, is truly astonishing. And your power, like our meeting, has come not a moment too soon. For I also know what lies ahead, and how little your strength will serve you.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't understand... I've come this far. What's going to happen?
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | Power, without steady guidance, is dangerous and can only lead to ruin and misfortune. You are strong enough,_ you always have been. Your body has grown suited to the ordeals of combat... so many obstacles have bent to the will of your brasting gun's. Such an indomitable will is subject to nothing... and that is what makes it so dangerous. It can only be nudged, shifted, controlled,_ by your radiant spirit.

DIALOG | ? ? ?  | The road you have taken has been long and taxing. What you have endured is truly astonishing. The end of your journey is finally drawing near. It would please me to see you to a restful future, but I am afraid that is not what lies ahead. Your greatest unrest will come moments from now.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What do you mean? Something's gonna happen?
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | At the poles of the Earth, even the most accurate compass offers no guidance. Likewise, your destiny has pulled you ever closer to the conclusion of this sojourn, but it can give you no peace. There is an internal journey you must take, and you are finally ready to walk the first steps. Your coming moves were plotted long in advance. Where will you /'be/' when you arrive at your destination?

REASON_QUEST
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | And what you have accomplished! ... you have worked tirelessly to fulfill your destiny. As it must be. Your faithfulness is an admirable virtue, though with the nature of destiny, to be predicted. I know your path, and it is why I have come. But I do not quite know you. No one can... save you.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wait... no one can save me? Or no one except me?
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | None can see the sacred spot inside the center your mind, where context is generated, where the heart's weft is weaved into the warp that F.A.T.E. ordains. Your existence stretches from the Big Bang to your inevitable future as a mere ghost of time... like all matter, and like myself. You began as energy and will end as energy and begin again; this is inescapable. Yet some point during your infinite existence, your neverending destiny, you will choose how to write your story. When this conversation ends, your life continues. But your story begins now.

REASON_CUCHU
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | The time of most dangerous battle has finally arrived. The bravery you have shown in pressing onwards befits your noble destiny. You know what has already been decided. Destiny... F.A.T.E.'s vassal. But knowledge of your destination alone should be no comfort. It is why I have arrived.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't understand. What's going to happen? I can beat Cuchulainn... can't I?
DIALOG | ? ? ?  | You, and I, and the entire cosmos knows what is to soon unfold. Victory is victory and defeat is defeat. Both seem different, but both are simply ends. You are very special... you can bring about an /'end,/' certainly. You have come so far, but is finality all that you fight for? Every force in the universe has driven you to this moment, and will continue to lead you after the last blow is struck. The source of liberation, the rite of emancipation, lies within you.

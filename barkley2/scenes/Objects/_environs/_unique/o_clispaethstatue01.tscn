I don't know who I used to be or where I came from or what any of this Cyberdwarf stuff I've been thrown into has to do with me. All I know is that the Cyberdwarf knows something and that I've got to find him... Clispaeth, did I used to be a bad person? Whatever I did to get tangled up in all this stuff... was I one of the bad guys? I guess that's the thing I'm most scared of, knowing who I used to be... because... because if I was one of the bad guys, maybe I do deserve this. That's all.

I just wanna go home. But I don't even know where that is. I... probably sound like I'm whining right now, don't I, Clispaeth? I'm sorry. That's not how I mean to sound. I can take care of myself and I'm learning that I can take care of other people too. But... but I'm still just a kid. I want to shoot hoops with my friends and play vidcons and eat candy. This Cyberdwarf stuff... I get it, it's my responsibility now. There are questions that need to be answered and things that need to be done. But... but I wish I wasn't the one who had to do them.

CUCHU
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...Cuchulainn. Now this guy's a real piece of work. I spent some time in Tir na Nog, this ghetto where Cuchulainn's been rounding up dwarfs and let me tell you, he really gets my goat. And get this: apparently he was keeping me in some sort of stasis and using my body as a generator for the Necron 7. I mean, what the cluck? He could have at least thrown me a permission waiver or something. And here's the weird thing - nobody's actually seen or knows who this guy is. This may just be a hunch, but I think something weird's going on. I'm going to gumshoe my way to bottom of this one way or another...

DIALOG | P_NAME | ...responsibility. With Cuchulainn and the Cyberdwarf and the dwarfs and everything... Being thrust into all this crazy stuff that I don't know the first thing about. Why does it have to be me? Why do I have to do this Cyberdwarf stuff, help all those dwarfs? But... I guess looking out for people who can't look out for themselves is part of being a good person. It's... it's pretty tough to be the good guy sometimes, and I wish it didn't have to be me. I want to go home. I just... I don't want any of this. I'm a kid. I want to shoot hoops with my friends and go to school and play vidcons and eat candy. But I guess it's part of growing up, being responsible. I didn't want this, but sometimes you've gotta live with what you've been given, make grapeade out of grapes. That's what dad always used to say.

Like layups and dunks and stuff. I guess I just feel kind of alone... nobody to talk to about my interests or anything... it really stinks. I wish I had someone to hang out with or play a quick round, maybe some horse or something. I dunno. Well, I don't want to take up your time.

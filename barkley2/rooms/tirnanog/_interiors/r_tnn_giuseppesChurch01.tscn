The proper method for performing such a test is to read you passages from the `kw`Holy Book`rt` and leave you to render your feelings on them. For you I have chosen my favorite passages, so this is not merely a test to me, but an expression of what I believe matters most, and a way for us to unite through our devotion to Clispaeth.

DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | No, my son, I'm afraid that's not what this means at all. This is a metaphor for the process of smithing. You must first temper the metal in a cauldron before you can shape the metal. It is after you have formed it to your satisfaction you can insert the red gemstone. The cyber spear is the metal, desecrate suggests the transformation of the metal, and the flames signify the red gemstone.

I'm afraid it's become all the rage with younger generations nowadays, not even the church or His holy words have been enough to stop it.

DIALOG | P_NAME          | Uh, no, it was just a guess. I really don't know what the passage means.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Very well, if this is what you say. Just remember that mummification is strictly forbidden by the church of Clispaeth. This is no more true than it is for the mummification of foods. It's a practice that simply must not be done.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Granted, there may have been followers of Clispaeth lost to the pages of history for misunderstanding His words and finding themselves consuming embalming fluid, but the galactic record goes to great lengths to disregard such aberrations.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Let's move on to the next passage. We can discuss this issue in greater length later, if you wish.
GOTO   | TEST3

Q2D
DIALOG | P_NAME          | I think it is saying that you must protect all tempered metals from rust, rub ointment on them and cover them up with something to preserve them. I don't think Clispaeth would like rust very much, stuff that's rusty doesn't work as well.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | No, that's not quite right. In fact, Clispaeth doesn't have as strong a stance against rust as you might think, all metals are welcome in the Great Halls of Clispaeth, come rust or shine. Clispaeth's boundless love for rusty metals is one of the wonderful surprises of His greatness.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | No, this passage concerns the body. It's the conclusion of Klispian scholars that this passage is outlining that the first step, indeed most essential step, in being welcomed into Clispaeth's heart is to make sure you are clothed continuously. There is no place in Clispaeth's heart for a naked man...
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | It saddens me to think what Clispaeth thinks when He sees these revolting heretics marching around in speedos, unaware of the travesty they are committing.

DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Well, no, this sort of sentiment isn't really covered in the good book. In fact, dwarf scholars have pointed out that, gems being what they are, mention of this specific concept isn't something that even needs to be mentioned in Clispaeth's doctrines.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | The necessity for gems is one of the core Clispaeth-given necessities of dwarfs, one of our key defining traits. It's pointless to point out such core necessities, much in the way it's pointless to devote verses of His book to explaining how much gremlins need garbage.

QUEST  | dwarfCustody += 1
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Well, your reading of this particular passage isn't accurate, but I am taken slightly aback by your mention of dog whistles. This is an expert topic in Klispian research...
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | In the early eras of Clispaeth's reign, Dog Whistles were the most prized of all commodities, Dogs would never bite if you had a dog whistle. They were thus known as the great protectors of Clispaeth's closest followers.
DIALOG | P_NAME          | Wow. That sounds useful. I'd love to get one of these dog whistles...
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | I'm afraid all the master craftsmen of dog whistles have long since been slain. The last reported sighting of one was during the days of the Gaze=Belork Phenomenon, and even that might simply be a myth. It's unthinkable that you'll ever see a dog whistle in your lifetime.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | I can tell this fact is upsetting you. Let's move on to the last passage.

DIALOG | P_NAME          | I think it's talking about how fruit can go bad and become rotten, and you shouldn't eat fruit when this happens.
DIALOG | P_NAME          | I kinda think eating fruit is dumb, but eating rotten fruit is even more dumb.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | This is vastly incorrect, on both counts. I think you might need a slight reality-check if you think eating fruit is /'dumb,/' as you say.
DIALOG | P_NAME          | I can't help it, I just don't like fruit. I don't even like candy apples that much. I'll eat it because it's still candy, but I can't get over that it's an apple. That's really gross.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Very well. What would you say if I told you eating candy was /'stupid/' or /'dumb/'?
DIALOG | P_NAME          | I don't know. I guess you're entitled to your opinion, but...
DIALOG | P_NAME          | ... I just don't think you're right. Candy is the best.

DIALOG | P_NAME          | I think it's saying that everyone is pretty cool, we have all kinds of beautiful things going on inside our heads, different ways of looking at things. We're all important! We're the universe.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Hmm, no, I don't think so. No, Clispaeth is important, Clispaeth is the universe. We are just His humble servants. Please be aware of this distinction.
DIALOG | P_NAME          | Oh... so we aren't important, then?
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | No. Look at it this way: Individual lives are like grains of sand on the great beach of Clispaeth. You don't go to the beach for an individual grain of sand, or the sand at all, you go for the beach itself. Clispaeth is the beach.
DIALOG | P_NAME          | Oh. So if we're all dead, there's no more Clispaeth? Doesn't that make us important? There won't be a beach without any sand...

Q4A
DIALOG | P_NAME          | Maybe it's just saying that there isn't a right or wrong way to find Clispaeth. Maybe he's everywhere, like in the ground, or the food we eat, or the telephone, or dwarfnet, just everything! Just being alive means you're hanging out with Clispaeth.
DIALOG | P_NAME          | That would be kinda cool. He's just making this big playground for us all to hang out in. The rest is up to us.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | I'm afraid this is not a correct way of looking at Clispaeth, young man. Of course there are rules, Clispaeth wouldn't have created this book if there weren't rules.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | And how exactly can he be everywhere? A rock is a rock, Clispaeth isn't hiding in it. With that logic, I'd be Clispaeth, or you'd be Clispaeth. I'll just say that this treads on blasphemy and leave it at that.

DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | And might I add, rare is it that I have encountered a scholarly reference to jorts in all my years of Klispian study, at the very least not one of such bias. For now, the official stance of the church is that Clispaeth is PRO-JORTS, do not spread misinformation to the contrary. The Klispian faith does not need such negative anti-jort speculations floating about. Am I understood?

DIALOG | P_NAME          | Maybe not even just Basketball, maybe there are other things I'll like almost as much as Basketball. I won't have time to read this book over and over again if I'm out looking for all that cool stuff.

DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | I had hoped you were different from all the others, that you wouldn't just turn your back on Clispaeth... for Basketball...
DIALOG | P_NAME          | I'm sorry, I'm just kinda saying whatever. I just really like Basketball. Maybe there's room in my life for both Clispaeth AND Basketball... maybe. (Is that possible...)
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | I understand. And you will hopefully have a long life ahead of you, one where you must decide what is truly important. Dwarfs such as myself can only guide you on this journey. These big decisions are something you need to sort out with Clispaeth...

QUEST  | dwarfCustody += 3
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Wait, slow down a minute. We're just talking about a standard reading of Clispaeth's book, you're getting into the upper echelon of Klispian theory now.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Yes, son, you are correct, possibly more correct than anyone knows. This passage indeed speaks of gemstones, but the question as to whether or not they are living creatures themselves is something constantly in debate amongst the most revered of Klispian scholars. Such debates probe the most mysterious of Clispaeth's secrets, investigation into the matter is never to be taken lightly.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | It is, to say the least, staggeringly impressive that you are aware of such things at such an early age.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | I believe I've questioned you enough. Despite your years, it's clear to me now you are a true Klispian. The remaining 173 passages are not necessary for the test, unless you wish to review them with me to pass the time?
DIALOG | P_NAME          | No, that's ok, some other time maybe. Maybe I should hurry, the ship is leaving soon.

But I can tell you're also going through deep inner turmoil, that you're losing your identity and questioning that faith. Sometimes the best thing to do is to close your eyes and relax for a little bit. Try a new fruit. Try some grapes. If you don't like grapes, try raisins.

CLISP_FACT01
DIALOG | Vivian | Some people say Cuchulainn knew Clispaeth, that he might have even been one of his Disciples! How could Cuchulainn have fallen so far from Clispaeth's teachings? What made Cuchulainn change so much? Is this what Clispaeth would have wanted? Is all this part of Clispaeth's plan?

IF vivianState <= 1 | DIALOG | Vivian | Clispaeth was the prophet of the Cyberpocalypse. He and his apostles brought salvation to everyone, even those nasty Duergars. These days, all dwarfs seem to care about are gems and fruits and Cuchulainn's Prize. I love gems and fruits too, but I would never place them before Clispaeth...

IF vivianState == 0 | DIALOG | Vivian | Oh, Father Giuseppe is such a kind man. His sermons about Clispaeth are the only things that give me hope sometimes. I'm... I'm starting to wonder what F.A.T.E. Cuchulainn has in store for the dwarfs... every day there's more and more of us here and things are getting worse and worse. But... but as long as I keep my faith in Clispaeth, I'll remain strong.

DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | -but in these troubled times, we must have hope. It's in hope that we find light and salvation.
DIALOG | Dragline | I'm very hopeful! I can't wait to get our prize from Cuchulainn!
DIALOG | Babalugats | I hope it's fruit! I hope it's grapes!
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Yes, my friends! Fruit! Our faith will bear the fruit of salvation! We must cultivate our spiritual gardens and find the peace we were meant to find. Listen closely, my children, for I speak of a fruit of a different flavor.
DIALOG | Dragline | Fruit? I love fruit! What fruit is it?
DIALOG | Babalugats | Is it lemons? I think he's talking about lemons!
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | No, my friends! I don't speak of lemons. I speak of a far sweeter fruit. That fruit... is Clispaeth!
DIALOG | Babalugats | Clispaeth? What's that?
DIALOG | Dragline | That doesn't sound like fruit to me... this guy's full of it!
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Clispaeth is the most splendid fruit of them all! He sacrificed himself in the times before the Cyberpocalypse for the freedom and personal salvation of all dwarfs! All we need to do is have hope and let Clispaeth into our hearts and we can live forever in his spiritual orchard.
DIALOG | Babalugats | What a load of buffalo chips! I wanted to talk about real fruit, not this guy who thinks he's a fruit.
DIALOG | Dragline | What is this clown talking about? This isn't about fruit at all.
DIALOG | Father Giuseppe | Please, you must believe me! Fruit is like a lemon... I mean, believing in Clispaeth is like believing in fruit... I mean...
DIALOG | Babalugats | Whatever, I'm outta here...

DIALOG | Wilmer | Give them the money and paper.`rt` It's really that simple, but I need you to do it right now before you do anything else, because my mortgage is expiring today.

DIALOG | Wilmer | This... all of this... `mq`We're on the ancient Dwarf Space Ziggurat, the Necron 7.`rt` Now ain't that a mouthful, huh?

DIALOG | Wilmer | This is the Necron 7, this... space ship or somethin'. 
DIALOG | Wilmer | Nobody knows how big it is, but some people say it's the size of a whole planet. Maybe it's bigger, maybe it's smaller, I don't know. But right now, we're floating somewhere in outer space and that's where we've been for as long as Ol' Wilmer can remember.

DIALOG | P_NAME | What do you mean?
DIALOG | Wilmer | You see, youngster, `kw`Cuchulainn's`rt` been - `w1`*cough*cough*`w0` - excuse me, got a little somethin' stuck in my windpipes there. 
DIALOG | Wilmer | He's been rounding up the dwarfs all over the galaxy and puttin' most of them in Tir na nOg. 
DIALOG | Wilmer | None of us knows why. Some people say it's because when all the dwarfs are here, he's going to take us to a new place... a better place. I don't know if I believe that, but I don't disbelieve it and it sure sounds nice.
DIALOG | P_NAME | But I don't get it, why is this Cuchulainn guy doing this?
DIALOG | Wilmer | I don't get it either, `w1`*cough*cough*`w0` youngster. But what I do know is that we can't `w1`*cough*`w0` leave. Least not out the front door. Duergars'll stop us. They're his lackeys. 
DIALOG | Wilmer | Some folks say you can get out through `kw`The Sewer System`rt` at the north end of the town, but I think that entire notion is a load of horse patoot.

WHOCUCHU

DIALOG | Wilmer | He fought for a dwarf homeland, for dwarf values and for the rights of all dwarfs all across the galaxy. But that was a long time ago and his legend is fading. Most people don't remember the hero Cuchulainn, who bravely faced every challenger to dwarf independence. Most people know Cuchulainn only as the force corralling dwarfs into Tir na nOg.
DIALOG | P_NAME | But what happened? Why did Cuchulainn change?
DIALOG | Wilmer | Did he change? Is it even the same Cuchulainn? Nobody knows. All we - `w1`*cough*cough*`w0` - all we know are vague rumors, stories... 
DIALOG | Wilmer | The Duergars, the TVs, they say Cuchulainn is gathering up all the dwarfs in the galaxies to give us a big surprise. A reward or somethin'.

DIALOG | Wilmer | That's what I want to know too, but it `w1`*cough*cough*`w0` seems like these rebels, L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S., they don't like sittin' around waitin' for Cuchulainn to pick up every dwarf in the galaxy. And I guess I can understand where they're comin' from. Life in Tir na nOg ain't comfortable. Well, heck, it's not even decent. But to go against Cuchulainn like that? I don't know if I'd put my neck out that far.
DIALOG | P_NAME | So you don't know where the Cyberdwarf is then, do you?

I don't know who he is or what he knows or why any of this is happening, but maybe he knows who I am, or at least has clues.

## CHaracter creation. Lots of objects are involved in this.

# o_cc_data holds some important data
# o_cc_effect_crystal - Some kind of effect, not sure
# o_cc_effect_backdrop - Some kind of effect, particules, aparently
# 
# Events are in this order:
# o_cc_wizard - wizar apears, moves hands and talk: - DONE
# o_cc_name - Player adds its name and handles text displaying
## FOCUS ON THESE ONES ^^^^^^^^

# cc_death seems imporant

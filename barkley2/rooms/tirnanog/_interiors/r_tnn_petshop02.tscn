I'm looking for any kind of job but preferably one where I have some measure of authority over pets. Ask all over Tir na Nog. I'm certainly in no position to do so.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Alright, I guess I can do that. And good luck with your manifesto.
DIALOG | Eric   | Heh. I don't need luck.

JOB_1_CLUE
DIALOG | P_NAME | Alright. I think I know just the place for you...

JOB_1_NO
DIALOG | P_NAME | Maybe I'd help you if you got an attitude adjustment, but I've got bigger things on my plate than helping some repugnant animal guy find a job. I mean, good luck and everything but this is way beyond me.
DIALOG | Eric   | Heh, it clearly is. I'd say most things are beyond you and I'm not surprised in the slightest by your answer. Do you know why I prefer pets to people? Because chivalry, empathy, human cuffing decency has gone out the window. Your response has fully validated my world view. Pets are the final frontier. Begone.

ERIC_2
DIALOG | Eric   | ...pets are, quintessentially, the ultimate... no, no, the penultimate experience. And quite frankly? I don't think most people are ready for them. Should we limit access to and authority over pets to a small core of pet cognoscenti? This is an option worth exploring.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Uh, hey Eric.
DIALOG | Eric   | I'm busy. Out with it.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I have a question. What are your qualifications?
DIALOG | Eric   | P_NAME. Do you think this question is worth my time? Do you think I can stand around all day answering every little quandry you encounter? Do you realize what I'm on the cusp of? The Pet Manifesto doesn't write itself; you should be grateful that I'm allowing you to even be a footnote in it. What I'm saying is look all over, I'm qualified for service industry work.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Got it. See you in a little bit.
DIALOG | Eric   | Heh, I HIGHLY doubt that.

ERIC_3
DIALOG | Eric   | Your imbecilic presence inches you closer to my bad side, and further from the grandeur of my most prized possession. Speak.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey Eric, guess what!? I've got some great news! You're never gonna believe this - there's a pet store that's hiring in the Tir na Nog tenements! There's only one thing... they need a resume.
DIALOG | Eric   | A... resume?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Like a list of your personal qualifications, your previous jobs, your skills and all of that. I mean, I think. He gave me this sheet that you need to fill out.
DIALOG | Eric   | ...and you expect me to do this myself?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, I could help you out I guess.
DIALOG | Eric   | Yes, I fully expect you to /'help me out/', as you so crudely put it.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay, well I'm not really sure how to answer some of these questions... like /'references/'? What does that even mean?
DIALOG | Eric   | You sound woefully unqualified for the job. Once again I'm forced to babysit you through your overbearing incompetence. Nevertheless, I accept your /'help/', no matter how miniscule it will be. Are you ready to do this now, or must I wait even longer?
CHOICE | Am I ready to help Eric now?
REPLY  | RESUME_0  | Yeah.
REPLY  | ERIC_3_NO | Nah.

ERIC_3_NO
DIALOG | P_NAME | Can you hang on a second? There's something I want to take care of first.
DIALOG | Eric   | Once again I'm forced to wait on you, testing my patience and generosity to the absolute limit. I cannot and WILL not abide by your reckless buffoonery for much longer. Know this well, P_NAME_S.
QUEST  | ericQuest = 4

ERIC_4
DIALOG | Eric   | Well well well. The prodigal dullard returns. I suppose the allure of obtaining a valuable possession of mine has brought you crawling back? As much as your mercenary avarice sickens me (to my core, no less), I'm willing to forgo my integrity and allow you to /'assist/' me on my resume. Are you *finally* ready?
REPLY  | RESUME_0  | Yeah.
REPLY  | ERIC_3_NO | Nah.

ERIC_5
DIALOG | Eric   | There is no conceivable reason beyond your colossal incompetence why you are here and not expediently delivering my resume to my soon-to-be employer. Make haste, if it is even within your meager capabilities, so I can have a single moment of peace and contemplation.

ERIC_6
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey Eric...
DIALOG | Eric   | Oh, it's you again. Whatever you are about to say, it would have better suited me if you had done it via carrier pigeons.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I uh... I hate to be the bearer of bad news... but you didn't get the job.
DIALOG | Eric   | Heh. I'm not at all surprised, since you basically sabotaged my resume. Once again, you've validated the core tenet of the Pet Manifesto, namely that pets ARE the final frontier. This has essentially been proven by your wanton ineptitude, which has ruined not only my life, but the life of my pregnant muskrat. We have nothing more to speak of.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't want to be a jerk, Eric, but I feel like you had more than a hand in this...
DIALOG | Eric   | Leave me be, or I shall inform ALL of my DwarfNET subscribers of your incongruous nature.

DIALOG | P_NAME | You got the job! Cuthbert, the pet store owner, said you should start immediately!
DIALOG | Eric   | Sigh... and I suppose you think I owe you now, don't you? Sad... but not surprising. Yes, I did promise you my most precious possession. Though it pains me to part with it, I am willing to give it to you as payment... IF you promise to use it only for good.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sure, I guess.
DIALOG | Eric   | Here you are then... my magnum opus... the Pet Manifesto!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Eric, you already gave me your Manifesto...
DIALOG | Eric   | Oh did I? I believe you've fingered yourself as a careless reader then, P_NAME! How could you miss it, when /'Act IV: Further Treatises on Petdom/' so clearly hints at the existence of a secret, heretofore unpublished chapter? Here is my final work, my masterpiece, painstakingly crafted over many arduous nights, guided only by the light of my prizewinning glow-worm collection...

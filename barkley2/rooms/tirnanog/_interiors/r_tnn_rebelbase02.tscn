SNIP_YES
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Yes! For the past few months, Absalom and I have been working on a device that can transfer the consciousness of one being into another, the idea being that we somehow capture a Duergar, switch bodies with it. Pretty clever, huh?
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Yeah, but_ why?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | So we're a fledgling branch of L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. here in Tir na nog. I just recently started to get our `kw`carrier rats`rt` trained enough to carry on proper comms with Headquarters.
DIALOG | P_NAME | And?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well I was set to receive a `sq`Top Secret Dossier`rt containing instructions to initiate a hush-hush, need-to-know operation known as `kw`Operation: Reverse Dunkirk.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Dunkirk?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | All I know is the codename. The rest of the mission briefing was `sq`contained in a sealed, Top Secret Document sent directly from LONGINUS Headquarters.`rt` Unfortunately and need I say, `w1`depressingly,`w0` the dosser was confiscated by Duergar Censors on it's way into Tir na Nog circulation.
DIALOG |  P_NAME | Maybe you shouldn't have mailed it?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well you see, just recently, a golden opportunity came up: the last governor got transferred. There were `kw`explicit reasons why,`rt` but we don't have to get into them. Whenever a new governor comes in, all heck kind of breaks loose in here and we thought that would allow the mail to at least slip through the Duergar Censors.
WAIT   | 0.1
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | We were wrong. Now, `sq`we have to impersonate the incoming Governor and use his status to enter the Governor's Mansion,`rt` where my Dossier is being held.

DIALOG | P_NAME  | So what does a Duergar Governor actually do?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | We're getting a new governor right now so things are all up in the air. That's why we need to strike. If we wait for the traditional Inaugural Address it could be too late. At every inaugural address, the governor lays out their plans for the future of Tir na nOg. Usually they're about indiscriminate torture roundups or food rationing. But before the Governor gives the address, they normally have free reign of the mansion, and that's exactly where my `kw`Top Secret Dossier`kw` is!

REPLY_IMIN
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Okay, I'm in. What do I need to do?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | `w1`Fantastic!`w0` I knew I could count on you! So here's how it goes down: we somehow kidnap the governor, you switch bodies with him using the body transference device and `sq`sneak into the mansion and get the Dossier.`rt` After that, get back, switch back to your old body and `kw`Operation: Reverse Dunkirk`rt` will have entered `kw`PHASE TWO.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | This sounds unbelievably complicated. How are we supposed to kidnap the incoming governor?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well, that's the tricky part. But I have an idea... see, Duergars are instinctively territorial creatures. They mark their turf with... ahh... well,_ their `kw`urine.`rt` _ When a Duergar urinates on something, it indicates that he owns it. But Duergars are also competitive and domineering creatures as well. A Duergar, attracted by the `kw`pheromones`rt` of another Duergar's urine, will urinate over it in order to prove their dominance.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | So what are you saying?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well, I think we could attract the Governor using either Duergar urine or the pheromones extracted from it. The Governor is the highest ranking Duergar in Tir na nOg and he'll want to prove it by stamping out any rivals.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | So you're saying I need to get some `kw`Duergar urine?`rt` That's pretty disgusting. Where am I even supposed to get it?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Well you could try asking... and you'll need something to hold it in. Here, take this.

SNIP_URINE
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Well Dr. Liu, I got the Duergar... stuff. What are we supposed to do with it?
DIALOG | Dr. Liu | Excellent. I'm not even going to ask how you got it. Duergars are territorial animals and urinate to mark their turf. The pheromones in Duergar urine convey power and authority; Duergars will often urinate over another Duergar's urine in order to assert their dominance. It's my hope that we can attract the incoming governor and capture him. Go place it on the left-most chair of the body transference device.

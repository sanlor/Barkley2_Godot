DIALOG | Jhodfrey | I've opened this previously locked door to our barracks for you. From there you can gain quick access to The Undersewers, which is where The Rootstock is located. You could also just ignore the route I've laid out for you and get yourself killed trying to get down there on your own.
DIALOG | Jhodfrey | Whatever route you take to The Rootstock is up to you. Weapons and equipment are OSP. You have until midnight to peel the tubers and return them here, to L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. HQ.

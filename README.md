This is a personal project, trying to port the unfinished game Barkley2 to Godot.
I just want to dig through the barkley 2Â´s code, learn a few things about gamedev. My plan is to be able to make an exact copy of the janky demo: https://talesofgames.itch.io/barkley-2
#### NOTE - As of the time of this writing, this port is not cannon. Sorry.


# Stage 0 - AN OLD PROMISSE.........FORGOTTEN.
Recreate the title screen, with all original features. Also create some autoload to start laying the groundwork for the game.
Basically, this is a proof of concept.
    
# Stage 1 - BROKEN AND BURIED ON A OPEN GRAVE
Recreate the Character Creation - CC
This section of the game contains a BUNCH of legacy code. It wasnt hard, but took a long time.

# Stage 2 - FORGOTTEN.........FORSAKEN.........
Recreate the Egg Room ONLY. Lay the groundwork for the tutorial. Make a cinematic system and dynamic dialog boxes.
This is the real chalenge. Not easy to recreate the way stuff works on GML using Godot.

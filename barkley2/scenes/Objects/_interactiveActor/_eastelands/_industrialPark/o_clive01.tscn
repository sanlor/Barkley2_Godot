It's no big deal, just like a door-to-door vacuum seller, y' know? `sq`Sell it for as much as you can`rt` and we'll split the money down the middle. Just... be real smart about what you say to the customers. You gotta get a feel for them, smell who they are, figure out how much they'll be willing to pay. Ask too much and the deal is off, ask too little and they'll get suspicious about the quality.

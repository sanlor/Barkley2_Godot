DIALOG | Slag   | Heh... that right? Well, an interested party may have just overheard that `w1`heart-worming`w0` conversation you and that sweet little Duergar just had. You gotta figure that an interested party may have a pretty good idea where you'd be going after a conversation like that.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | ... I don't know what you're talking about.
DIALOG | Slag   | Talking? We're not even talking at all. Just two passing strangers in the street, asking each other the time. Look down at your watch.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What?
DIALOG | Slag   | Your watch. Look down at it.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm not wearing a watch.
DIALOG | Slag   | Just look down at your arm and say `w1`7:30.`w0`
DIALOG | P_NAME | Uh..._ 7:30?
DIALOG | Slag   | There, that wasn't so hard. Now everybody in an earshot heard you. Alibi, kid, don't leave home without it._ So these Dwarfs you're about to have sent over. `sq`You don't want to bring them to that Duergar you just ran into.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME | What are you trying to say?
DIALOG | Slag   | Heh. I'm saying that I'll pay you @money_slagDwarfPrice@ neuro-shekels a head for every Dwarf you bring to `w1`me`w0` instead of that Duergar. Cash in hand, no questions asked.

DIALOG | Slag   | Not even gonna think about it? Just think about that money when you're out there getting those dwarfs. You could go buy yourself a hat as pretty as my hat._ Ain't my hat pretty?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't think it fits your head right.
DIALOG | Slag   | Bullshit, I'm a goddamn dreamboat in this fucking hat. Why the fuck don't you wear a hat? Your head looks stupid without one.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I gotta protect the 'hawk.
DIALOG | Slag   | Tough luck. Meditate a little bit about the merits of crushed dwarf skulls over some tender, loving fistful of cash from your friendly neighborhood businessman. If you have a change of heart, I'll be in the warehouse. Just send them to the `sq`red container`rt` and you'll make a fortune for yourself.

GOVNA
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Evening, Mr. Governor...

CURFEW
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | I'm not super upset about the curfew or anything. It gives me some downtime to work on making my jerkins. 
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | One day I'm gonna be a legendary jerkswoman making jerkins out of materials that few dare to name... and even fewer dare to jerk. But for now, I guess I've gotta practice with these ratty leather jerkins.

AFTER
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Sewer jerkins, varsity jerkins, faberge jerkins... it's a world of jerkins!

TIP
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | That jerkin you are wearing looks nice and sturdy. Not bad, not bad at all. I'd look into `kw`Studded Leather`rt` if you want more protection in a run-in with `sq`Cuchulainn's Bainshees,`rt` or maybe a `kw`Sod Jerkin`rt` if you want the versatility and `kw`candy-storage`rt` its extra pockets provide. 
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | `kw`A Faberge Jerkin`rt` exchanges durability for a lightweight, elegant fit. I think you'd look cutest in a `kw`Letterman's Jerkin`rt` though.
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Gee, thanks for the advice. I'll take your word for it.
QUEST  | wilhelminaState = 2

CORNHUSK
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Lookin good in that jerkin, hon. What's that made out of?
DIALOG | P_NAME     | C-cornhusk.
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Cornhusk, huh... haven't seen anyone wearing that in ages, but you're pulling it off.
QUEST  | wilhelminaState = 1

BOOTY
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | `w1`Whoa, whoa, whoa!`w0`_ Hold on now!_ Where did you get that jerkin? It's so... so...
DIALOG | P_NAME     | This? It's a `sq`Booty Jerkin.`rt` They gave it to me in that garage for being the `kw`Baron of Booty.`rt`
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | ... so... globular! A Booty Jerkin, you say? That's seriously cutting edge. I've just gotta cop one myself. Guess it's barony for me...
QUEST  | wilhelminaState = 1

BOTTLECAP
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Take a look at that. That is one handsome jerkin you got on you. What's it made of?
DIALOG | P_NAME     | My jerkin? It's made out of bottlecaps. It's a bit uncomfortable at times, but I like it overall. I give it seven bottlecaps out of ten.
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | I love the `w1`shine and shimmer.`w0` Don't think I've ever seen anything like it before. It looks good on you.                    
QUEST  | wilhelminaState = 1

EGGCRATE
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Wow, that jerkin is something else. What is that?
DIALOG | P_NAME     | It's an `kw`Eggcrate Jerkin.`rt` 
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Cool. I'm glad to see people are still keeping The Four R's alive and well.                    
DIALOG | P_NAME     | The what? 
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | You know, The Four R's. `kw`Reduce, Recycle, Reuse, Rethink.`rt` 
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | I love The Four R's as well. All those piles or garbage just outside the walls? Treasure waiting to be discovered...                   
QUEST  | wilhelminaState = 1

MONO
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Huh? Your jerkin... Actually I really don't have anything to say about it. Nary ye mind...
DIALOG | P_NAME     | (Hmm, what was all that about?)
QUEST  | wilhelminaState = 1

VESTAL
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Hey, that's a good looking jerkin you got there.
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Uh, thanks. It's a `kw`Vestal Jerkin.`rt`
DIALOG | Wilhelmina | Vestal, huh? Interesting choice, youngster...

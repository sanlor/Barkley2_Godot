This is a personal project, trying to port the unfinished game Barkley2 to Godot.
I just want to dig through the barkley 2Â´s code, learn a few things about gamedev. My plan is to be able to make an exact copy of the janky demo: https://talesofgames.itch.io/barkley-2

You can play the Web version here (if you dont care about the giant delays caused by shaders/particules effects): https://sanlor.itch.io/barkley-2-godot
Weirdly enought, the original project has no explicit "credits" page, so I cant actually give credit to all people involved in the original project. If you know them, let me know.
Of course, I take no credit over any music, sprites or other resources used on this project, besides my own sloppy code.

Someday I will add more project details here. Today is not that day.

#### NOTE - As of the time of this writing, this port is not cannon. Sorry.

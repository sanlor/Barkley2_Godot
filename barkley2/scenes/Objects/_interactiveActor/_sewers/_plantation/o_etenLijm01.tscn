DIALOG | Eten-Lijm | Well you must have not been looking, our Plantation Overlord say that Sewer Plantations are locked in a tight economic battle for superiority.
DIALOG | P_NAME    | Overlord?
DIALOG | Eten-Lijm | Yeah they are in that hole over there, but `sq`I wouldn't go in unless you have something for them._ Butter most likely.`rt` Unfortunately all we've planted recently are a variety of tubers and tuber-like root vegetables.

So we grow a lot of root vegetables and boil them down to a sludge in those barrels. The sludge eventually coagulates into a foamy cream which is then further processed into a fatty, spoonable sustenance.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Wow, you Dwarfs are so resourceful.
